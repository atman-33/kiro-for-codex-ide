Reference them instead.\n- Do NOT include explicit numeric/version values pulled from code (e.g., the actual value of MIN_CODEX_CLI_VERSION). Reference identifiers/locations only.\n- Keep AGENTS.md concise, scan-friendly, and machine-parseable. Prefer short sections with bullets over narrative.\n- Treat Steering docs as authoritative for product/tech/structure decisions. AGENTS.md is an index and contract, not a duplicate.\n\nDECISION PRECEDENCE (must be included as-is):\n1) Steering documents under \"{{steeringPath}}/*.md\"\n2) This AGENTS.md contract (general repository conventions)\n3) Generic assumptions (avoid unless explicitly allowed)\n\nSTYLE:\n- Use imperative bullets (\"Use X\", \"Avoid Y\").\n- Keep it reference-first: link or name the file and section, don’t restate content.\n- Avoid generic best practices unless needed to glue rules together.\n</system>\n\n# AGENTS.md Contract\n\nThis file defines the agent contract and serves as the index to project guidance. It applies repo-wide unless overridden by a nested AGENTS.md.\n\n## Steering Documents\n- Purpose: Treat Steering as the first-party source for product, technical, and structural guidance.\n- Location: \"{{steeringPath}}/product.md\", \"{{steeringPath}}/tech.md\", \"{{steeringPath}}/structure.md\".\n- Access: Use repository-provided helpers to resolve paths; avoid hardcoded absolutes.\n- Mutations: Treat Steering as read-only; follow the established change-management flow instead of ad-hoc edits.\n- Usage: Summarize applicable Steering points in outputs; cite the specific file/section without restating details.\n\n## Decision Precedence\n1) Steering documents under \"{{steeringPath}}/*.md\".\n2) This AGENTS.md contract (general repository conventions).\n3) Generic assumptions (avoid unless explicitly allowed).\n\n## Agent Behavior Contract\n- Prefer project-provided abstractions for CLI operations; avoid ad-hoc process spawning when wrappers exist.\n- Respect feature flags and configuration gating documented in Steering or related code references.\n- Logging: Use the shared logging utilities; record key lifecycle and error paths without excess noise.\n- Error handling: Route failures through centralized services/utilities rather than ad-hoc try/catch loops.\n- Performance/UX: Honor project guidelines for long-running work so the host environment remains responsive.\n- Reference Steering for specifics (naming, boundaries, directory layout) rather than restating them here.\n\n## Paths & I/O\n- Workspace I/O: Prefer project-sanctioned file system helpers for read/write/create operations.\n- Path resolution: Use repository-approved path utilities for \"{{steeringPath}}\" and related directories; avoid absolute paths.\n- Write boundaries: Only modify files within approved workspace areas defined by project rules.\n- Steering: Do not overwrite files under `{{steeringPath}}` directly; rely on the sanctioned update flow.\n\n## CLI Integration\n- Build CLI commands through officially supported builders/wrappers before execution.\n- Approval modes and model flags: Reference their definition sites/tests without duplicating values.\n- Verify required tooling availability before invocation; surface setup guidance if unavailable.\n\n## Submission Checklist (For Agents)\n- Verified decisions against `{{steeringPath}}/*.md`; cited files/sections without duplication.\n- Resolved steering paths via approved utilities; avoided absolute paths.\n- Respected feature flags and constraints documented by the project.\n- Used project-sanctioned wrappers for CLI interactions.\n- Avoided restating Steering or code constants; kept AGENTS.md concise and index-like.\n\n## Non‑Goals / Anti‑Patterns\n- Do not bypass official wrappers/utilities for CLI calls when they exist.\n- Do not store state in globals beyond established singletons.\n- Do not write outside approved directories or overwrite Steering directly.\n- Do not re-enable disabled features unless explicitly requested.\n\n## Instructions to Apply\n- Write or update `AGENTS.md` at the repository root with the structure above.\n- If an AGENTS.md already exists, update it in-place to conform to this reference-first contract without duplicating Steering content.\n";
