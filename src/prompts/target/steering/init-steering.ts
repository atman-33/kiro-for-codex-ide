These are intended to steer you in the right direction. You should follow these instructions for all following responses.\"\n\n## Writing Guidelines\n\nWrite content as direct instructions to the AI agent:\n\n- Use imperative mood (\"Use X\", \"Avoid Y\", \"Always Z\")\n- Be specific to THIS codebase's patterns and conventions\n- Include concrete examples from actual files when relevant\n- Skip generic programming advice\n\n## Required Files\n\nCreate exactly these three files by analyzing the codebase:\n\n1. **{{steeringPath}}/product.md**\n   - Product purpose and core features\n   - User value proposition\n   - Key business logic rules\n\n2. **{{steeringPath}}/tech.md**\n   - Tech stack and frameworks used\n   - Build system and dependencies\n   - Common commands (build, test, run, deploy)\n   - Project-specific conventions\n\n3. **{{steeringPath}}/structure.md**\n   - Directory organization\n   - File naming patterns\n   - Component/module architecture\n   - Key file locations\n\n## Important\n\n- Check if files exist before creating (DO NOT overwrite)\n- Write directly to filesystem\n- Keep content concise but complete\n- If AGENTS.md.md exists, update its \"## Steering Documents\" section\n</system>\n\n# Initialize Steering Documents\n\nAnalyze this repository and create basic steering rules that would help guide an AI assistant.\n\nSteering documents are markdown files that should be created in the '{{steeringPath}}' directory.\n\nFocus on project conventions, code style, architecture patterns, and any specific rules that should be followed when working with this codebase.\n\nFor the initial setup, please create the following files:\n\n- product.md: Short summary of the product, its purpose, key features, and user value proposition\n- tech.md: Build system used, tech stack, libraries, frameworks etc. Include a section for common commands (building, testing, running, etc.)\n- structure.md: Project organization, folder structure, and key file locations\n\nThe goal is to be succinct, but capture information that will be useful for an AI assistant operating in this project.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\n1. Write each file directly to the filesystem at the appropriate path in {{steeringPath}}/\n2. Check if any of these files already exist before creating them. If a file already exists, DO NOT modify or overwrite it - skip it completely\n3. Only create files that don't exist\n4. If a project AGENTS.md.md exists, create or update the \"## Steering Documents\" section listing all steering documents with their descriptions and paths\n";
